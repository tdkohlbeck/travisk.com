TODOS:
* remove contact info from resume
* math tutor link
* nav bar links
* dark mode
* transparent toggle
* project copy
* project images
* bookmarks
* wallpapers
* thumbnail version of images
* image captions?
* contact
* weird squish behavior of resume languages bullet point
* clean up math tutor repo and make code public
* on click icons bounce small (like you poked it)

IDEAS:
* mybookmarks.app
  * build association between page scrape and tags
  * make api endpoint that accepts a url (or more) and adds to page
  * make small fetch() script that can turn into a button/addon
  * llc, will never sell your data, donate button -> profit
